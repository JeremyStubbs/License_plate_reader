## Automatic License Plate Reader
This project implements a pre-trained neural network to interpret a video feed in real time. The main file is "webcam.py" Detected unique license plates are saved to a log every minute. The project uses keras, opencv, matplotlib, and numpy.

The saved images can then be piped into an OCR model like tesseract.
