## Automatic License Plate Reader
The purpose of this project was to implement a pre-trained neural network to interpret a video feed in real time. Unique license plates detected will be saved to a log every minute. The project uses keras, opencv, matplotlib, and numpy. The code for images is found in the file named my_reader.ipynb and the code for the fully operational webcam program is in  webcam.py.

The final code is a combination of the two resouces below.

This project is based on Sergio Silva and Claudio Jung's paper found at https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Sergio_Silva_License_Plate_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf. The repo is https://github.com/sergiomsilva/alpr-unconstrained.

I used this website to help understand the paper https://medium.com/@quangnhatnguyenle/detect-and-recognize-vehicles-license-plate-with-machine-learning-and-python-part-1-detection-795fda47e922.
